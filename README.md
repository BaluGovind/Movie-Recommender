# Movie-Recommender
This project attempts to launch a webpage supported by a database of more than 9000 movies and the idea is to come up with recommendations based on 3 types of user inputs.

The user can input a number and a function will diplay the entered number of top hits.
The user can enter the name of a movie and a number resulting in the entered number of similar movies.
The user can enter a user ID and will get a list of movies that were favored by that user.
